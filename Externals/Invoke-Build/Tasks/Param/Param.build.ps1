### Simple approach with a function

function Invoke-Something($Param1, $Param2) {
	"
	Param1 = $Param1
	Param2 = $Param2
	"
}

# Synopsis: Invoke-Something with some parameters.
task Something1 {
	Invoke-Something data1 data2
}

# Synopsis: Invoke-Something with other parameters.
task Something2 {
	Invoke-Something data3 data4
}

### Advanced approach with a custom task

# Import
. ./Param.task.ps1

# Synopsis: Custom task with some parameters.
MyTask CustomTask1 data1 data2

# Synopsis: Custom task with other parameters.
MyTask CustomTask2 data3 data4
