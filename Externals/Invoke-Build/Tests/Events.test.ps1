.Synopsis
	Tests build events.

.Description
	The tasks and events of this script set a noise location and check that on
	calling the current location is restored to $BuildRoot.

	Task and job event scopes must be the same for a task.

.Example
	Invoke-Build * Events.test.ps1

Set-Location $HOME

# Enter-Build is called before the first task in the script scope.
# Its local definitions are available for tasks and event blocks.
